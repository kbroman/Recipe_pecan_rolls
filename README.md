## Pecan caramel rolls

This is basically the [Betty
Crocker recipe](https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/caramel-pecan-sticky-rolls/4077c5ea-0aa4-4e72-815e-8d12aadbbe87).

### Ingredients

#### Rolls

- 3 1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose or bread flour
- 1/3 cup granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 packages regular active or fast-acting dry yeast (1/2 οz = 4 1/2 teaspoons)
- 1 cup very warm milk (120°F to 130°F)
- 1/4 cup butter, softened
- 1 egg
- Crisco to grease bowl

#### Caramel topping

- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- 1/2 cup butter, softened
- 1/4 cup light corn syrup
- 1 cup pecan halves, if desired

#### Filling

- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1/4 cup butter (1/2 stick), melted
- 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans

### Steps

1. In a large bowl, stir 2 cups of the flour, 1/3 cup granulated sugar, the salt and yeast with a wooden spoon until well mixed. In a 1-quart saucepan, heat the milk over medium heat until very warm and an instant-read thermometer reads 120°F to 130°F. Add the warm milk, 1/4 cup butter and egg to the flour mixture. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed 1 minute, stopping frequently to scrape batter from side and bottom of bowl with a rubber spatula, until flour mixture is moistened. Beat on medium speed 1 minute, stopping frequently to scrape bowl. With a wooden spoon, stir in enough of the remaining flour, about 1/2 cup at a time, until dough is soft, leaves side of bowl and is easy to handle (dough may be slightly sticky). [I do it all in a stand mixer using dough hook; I use a spatula to stir dry ingredients, at the beginning.]

2. Sprinkle flour lightly on a countertop or large cutting board. Place dough on floured surface. Knead by folding dough toward you, then with the heels of your hands, pushing dough away from you with a short rocking motion. Move dough a quarter turn and repeat. Continue kneading about 5 minutes, sprinkling surface with more flour if dough starts to stick, until dough is smooth and springy. Grease a large bowl with Crisco. Place dough in bowl, turning dough to grease all sides. Cover bowl loosely with plastic wrap; let rise in a warm place about 1 hour 30 minutes or until dough has doubled in size. Dough is ready if an indentation remains when you press your fingertips about 1/2 inch into the dough.

3. In 2-quart saucepan, heat brown sugar and 1/2 cup butter to boiling, stirring constantly; remove from heat. Stir in corn syrup. Pour into 13x9-inch pan. Sprinkle with pecan halves.

4. In a small bowl, mix brown sugar and the cinnamon; set aside. Grease the bottom and sides of a 13x9-inch pan with Crisco. Sprinkle flour lightly on a countertop or large cutting board. Gently push your fist into the dough to deflate it. Pull the dough away from the side of the bowl, and place it on the floured surface.

5. Using your hands or a rolling pin, flatten dough into a 15x10-inch rectangle. Spread 1/4 cup butter over dough to within 1/2 inch of edges. Sprinkle with sugar-cinnamon mixture. Beginning at a 15-inch side, roll dough up tightly. Pinch edge of dough into the roll to seal edge. Stretch and shape roll until even and 15 inches long. Using a sharp serrated knife, cut roll into 15 (1-inch) slices. Place slices slightly apart in the pan. Cover pan loosely with plastic wrap; let rise in a warm place about 30 minutes or until dough has doubled in size. Remove plastic wrap. [I cut them into 16 pieces.]

6. Move the oven rack to the middle position of the oven. Heat the oven to 350°F. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until golden brown. Let stand 2 to 3 minutes. Place heatproof tray or serving plate upside down onto pan; immediately turn tray and pan over. Let pan remain 1 minute so caramel can drizzle over rolls; remove pan. Serve warm.

### Overnight method:

- through step 5 but without additional rise; cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate
- put pan of hot water on lower rack of oven; put uncovered rolls on middle rack. close oven and leave for 30 min
- take everything out of the oven and preheat to 350°
- bake 30 min

[I always use this overnight method.]
